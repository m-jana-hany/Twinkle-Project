## üöÄ Project Summary: A Vision for Los Angeles 2050

The Twinkle Project is a high-fidelity, **interactive urban revitalization blueprint** for Los Angeles, CA. It was developed to directly address the NASA Space Apps challenge: **"Data Pathways to Healthy Cities and Human Settlements."**

**The Goal:** To transform a major metropolitan area grappling with severe social crises (homelessness) and environmental risks (Urban Heat Islands and pollution) into a global model of a **healthy, resilient, and Zero-Waste city.**

**The Innovation:** We directly integrate **NASA Earth Observation data** into a dynamic urban design model, providing a data-backed vision for mitigating environmental and social risks through implementable, community-focused solutions.

## üí° How We Used NASA Data (Data Pathways)

To ensure our solutions are measurable and impactful, we leveraged satellite data to accurately pinpoint high-risk areas and inform our urban design proposals:

| NASA Resource Used | Objective & Application | Associated Site Section |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Landsat 8/9 & MODIS** | Mapped Land Surface Temperatures (LST) to precisely identify **Urban Heat Islands** (UHIs) in distressed neighborhoods (e.g., Skid Row). | The Interactive "Explore the Present" Map |
| **AURA Satellite (OMI)** | Monitored air quality and identified concentrations of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and pollutants in industrial congestion zones. | "Air Quality Analysis" within the "Problem" section |
| **Historical Data Comparison** | Analyzed the evolution of these risks over a 5-year period, establishing a baseline for the next 25-year revitalization plan. | The "A Brighter Future" section |

## üéØ Key Interactive Solutions (Winning Features)

Our site is designed as an **interactive experience** to prove the viability and impact of our proposal to the judges:

1.  **Interactive Problem Map:** (Explore the Present Section)
    * Uses location markers on a Los Angeles map linked to a specific problem (wildfires, pollution, homelessness).
    * Each click reveals precise, data-driven insights sourced from our NASA data analysis.
2.  **Future Pillars:** (A Brighter Future Section)
    * A seamless **tab system** (Tabs) comparing **"A Resilient Environment"** vs. **"A United Community."**
    * Uses smooth `Fade-in/out` effects to clearly showcase the impact of **Smart Eco-Housing** and **Urban Agriculture** on quality of life.
3.  **Dark Mode Aesthetic:** Utilizes a modern, comfortable color scheme that reflects the futuristic, data-heavy nature of the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology & Challenges

| Element | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Technologies Used** | **HTML5**, **Tailwind CSS** (for rapid, utility-first styling), **Vanilla JavaScript** (for interactivity). |
| **Biggest Challenge** | Integrating complex, raw data concepts from NASA resources into a simple, intuitive web design accessible to the average viewer. |
| **Key Achievement** | Successfully built a **Dynamic Content Rendering** system to handle all tab-switching logic, enhancing user experience and site speed. |
